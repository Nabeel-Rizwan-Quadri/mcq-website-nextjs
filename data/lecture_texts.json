Different specific patterns of physical bodily activity are interpreted by the brain as different emotions. \u201cWe feel afraid, because we are sweating.\u201d 8\nPage 10: Psychophysiology: History Emotions and physiology ,, Moreover, the patient\u2019s pulse and disposition are altered when mention is made of the person he loves, and especially when this occurs suddenly. It is possible in this way to ascertain whom he loves, when he will not reveal it himself. The nature of the cure is this: let several names be pronounced, repeating them many times, and place your finger on the patient's pulse. When it varies by a large fluctuation and then returns to normal, and this is repeated thereafter, and is put to the test many times, then the name of the one he loves will be known. \u201d \u2013 Ibn Sina (1025).

Krol 2023-11-21 0\nPage 2: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Structural definition The nervous system refers to the collection of neurons and supportive glial cells in the body. The central nervous system (CNS) refers to the brain and spinal cord, contained within the dorsal body cavity. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) refers to (parts of) neurons outside of the brain and spinal cord. Figure: \u201cTE-Nervous system diagram\u201d by The Emirr is licensed under CC BY 3.0 / Changed colours, prolonged spinal cord 1\nPage 3: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Functional definition 2 The nervous system transmits signals between different parts of the body in order to coordinate physical action and process sensory information. Neural activity is not the only communication system in the body: the endocrine system uses hormones for communication. (But is largely controlled by the nervous system.)\nPage 4: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Functional definition 3 \u2022 Somatic nervous system Controls interaction with the external environment: \u2022 Carries sensory impressions to the CNS \u2022 Controls activity of (voluntary) striated muscles \u2022 Autonomic nervous system Controls the internal environment: \u2022 Controls activity of glands \u2022 Controls activity of organs \u2022 Controls smooth (involuntary) and cardiac muscles\nPage 5: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Functional definition 4 The autonomic nervous system can be divided into two separate systems. \u2022 Sympathetic nervous system Dominant in \u201cfight or flight\u201d situations \u2022 Parasympathetic nervous system Dominant in \u201crest and digest\u201d situations\nPage 6: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation Figures from OpenStax are licensed under CC BY 4.0 5\nPage 7: Psychophysiology: Nervous system Overview 6 Nervous system Central nervous system Brain and spinal cord Peripheral nervous system Everything else Somatic nervous system \u201cExternal\u201d, sensory and voluntary motor functions Autonomic nervous system \u201cInternal\u201d, involuntary functions Sympathetic nervous system \u201cFight or flight\u201d Parasympathetic nervous system \u201cRest and digest\u201d Brain activity Facial expressions Skin conductance Heart rate\nPage 8: Psychophysiology Nervous system The human nervous system can be divided into structurally and functionally separate systems. We have the central, peripheral, somatic, and autonomic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system furthermore consists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems which behave antagonistically between \u201cfight or flight\u201d and \u201crest and digest\u201d. 7\nPage 9: * Psychophysiology Part 2.1: Overview of the human nervous system Dr. Laurens R.

It is maintained by the Na\u207a/K\u207a pump (sodium-potassium pump), which actively transports Na\u207a ions outwards, and K\u207a ions inwards. Aside from the Na\u207a/K\u207a pump, there are a number of gates in the cell membrane that can open and close under different circumstances. This can change the potential across the membrane.\nPage 10: Psychophysiology: Neurons Ion channels / \u201cgates\u201d Figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / Cropped; removed voltmeter, ions, and labels 9\nPage 11: Psychophysiology: Neurons Postsynaptic potentials 10 Dendrite Synapse\nPage 12: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials The synapse Figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 11\nPage 13: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials Neurotransmitter Figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 12\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Neurons Postsynaptic potentials Voltmeter figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 Potential figure by the author is in the public domain 13\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials Temporal and spatial summation 14 Axon hillock Synapse\nPage 16: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials Temporal summation Figure by the author is in the public domain 15\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials Spatial summation 16 Axon hillock\nPage 18: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Postsynaptic potentials Excitation and inhibition 17 Excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) Inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP)\nPage 19: Psychophysiology: Neurons Signal integration Figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 18\nPage 20: Psychophysiology: Neurons Signal integration Figure originally by Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal is in the public domain 19\nPage 21: Psychophysiology: Neurons Action potential 20 Axon Action potential Axon hillock\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Action potential Voltage-gated ion channels Figure from OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / Cropped; removed voltmeter, ions, and labels 21\nPage 23: Psychophysiology: Neurons: Action potential Voltage-gated ion channels Voltage-gated ion channels are closed when the membrane potential is near its resting potential (-70 mV).

An ideal electrode does not change the properties of the tissue it is connected to, nor does it interfere with the signal it measures. The ideal electrode does not exist. Choose the electrode material and placement based on the biosignal you intend to measure.\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Measurement: Electrodes Electrode placement Most physiological measurements reflect potential differences. What is needed to record one channel of such biopotentials? 13 Recording electrode Reference electrode Ground electrode\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Measurement: Electrodes Bipolar and unipolar recording techniques 14 Placement specifics will be discussed for the different psychophysiological modalities. In general, there is: \u2022 Bipolar measurement: Each recorded channel reflects the difference between two (different) electrodes. \u2022 Unipolar or reference measurement: All recorded channels share the same reference electrode. (Either way, all electrodes do usually share the same ground electrode.)\nPage 16: Bipolar Unipolar Psychophysiology: Measurement: Electrodes Bipolar and unipolar recording techniques 15 Ground Channel 2 Channel 1 Reference Ground Channel 1 Channel 2 Channel 3 Channel 4\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Measurement: Electrodes: Unipolar The reference electrode in unipolar recordings Recording or \u201cactive\u201d electrodes are placed near \u201celectrically active\u201d regions to measure voltage relative to an \u201celectrically neutral\u201d reference electrode.

We need to \u2022 formulate precise questions, \u2022 employ appropriate measurement modalities, \u2022 identify factors that could confuse the answer, and \u2022 draw valid conclusions from the data. 4\nPage 6: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Concepts and constructs A concept is a generally accepted understanding of objects, situations, events, etc., in terms of associated characteristics or meanings. A construct is a more abstract idea, usually combining multiple concepts into a whole that is more difficult to verify. The concepts and constructs used in scientific research need to be defined carefully. Operationalisation creates a definition in terms of specific, measurable or otherwise testable criteria. 5\nPage 7: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Concepts and constructs: Example Heart rate is a concept, generally understood in terms of associated characteristics concerning the number of contractions a heart performs in a minute. EEG activity is a concept, generally understood in terms of voltage differences related to specific neuronal activity as measured by scalp electrodes. Mental workload is a construct that may be understood in terms of a specific parameter in a \u201cworkload task\u201d, or in terms of specific patterns of cardial and EEG activity, or in terms of \u2026? Physiological measurements usually clear\u2014psychological phenomena in particular require careful operationalisation! 6\nPage 8: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables In experimental design, operationalised concepts and constructs are generally represented by variables. \u201c\u2026 a variable is a symbol of an event, act, characteristic, trait, or attribute that can be measured and to which we assign values.\u201d The regularities in nature which science aims to find are expressed as relationships between variables. Cooper, D. R., & Schindler, P. S. (2014). Business research methods (Twelfth ed.). New York, NY, USA: McGraw-Hill Irwin. 7\nPage 9: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables A relationship has at least one independent variable (IV) and one dependent variable (DV); e.g. \u201cIV influences DV\u201d. The IV is \u201cmanipulated\u201d by the researcher in order to induce the assumed effect on the DV. The DV is then measured or otherwise observed to confirm. 8 Independent variable Dependent variable\nPage 10: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Experimental manipulation can happen within-subjects, meaning different values of the IV are induced in the same test subjects, or between-subjects, meaning different test subjects are used for the different values of the IV. 9 Intelligence School performance Hunger School performance\nPage 11: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Moderating variables (MoVs) influence the relationship, and are included to better describe the relationship. 10 Independent variable Dependent variable Moderating variable\nPage 12: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Moderating variables (MoVs) influence the relationship, and are included to better describe the relationship. 11 Intelligence School performance Teaching quality\nPage 13: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Mediating variables (MeVs) help explain the mechanisms of the IV-DV relationship, but are not manipulated directly. 12 Independent variable Dependent variable Mediating variable\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Mediating variables (MeVs) help explain the mechanisms of the IV-DV relationship, but are not manipulated directly. 13 Intelligence School performance Student motivation\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables Mediating variables can be fully or partially mediating. 14 Intelligence School performance Student motivation\nPage 16: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables These are the variables that are part of the (hypothesised) theoretical model. - Independent variable: manipulated to induce an effect. - Dependent variable: measured to reveal the effect. - Moderating variable: influences a relationship. - Mediating variable: mediates a relationship. 15\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables What could a model for an EEG-based mental workload measurement look like? 16 IV: Task MeV: Workload MoV: Experience DV: EEG\nPage 18: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables There are additional variables that are not part of the theoretical model. They do not help explain the relationship of interest, but do play a role in our experiment investigating that relationship. - Extraneous variable (EV): any factor that might conceivably influence the relationship or the results. Usually ignored. - Control variable (CtV): EV that is included in the investigation in order to prevent biased results. - Confounding variable (CfV): relevant EV that we cannot (or forgot to) control for. 17\nPage 19: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables The CfV is often defined as influencing both the IV and the DV, causing a spurious relationship. More generally, CfVs can also act as MoVs or MeVs. 18 Ice cream sales People drowning Good weather\nPage 20: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Basics Variables What are possible extraneous variables in the example \u201cintelligence \u2192 school performance\u201d model?

Different kinds of variables are a part of that model. Other influences need to be controlled. 20\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Experimentation Psychophysiology-specific design issues 21\nPage 23: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Psychophysiological inference We assume that some psychological state \u03a8 (psi) is expressed as some physiological state \u03a6 (phi). 22 IV: \u03a8 DV: \u03a6\nPage 24: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Psychophysiological inference Multiple psychological, physiological, and environmental factors (EVs) may need to be included as IV or CtV to avoid confounded results. Multiple DVs may be required to find a pattern that is sufficiently specific to the IV. Figure: Cacioppo, J., Tassinary, L. G., & Berntson, G. G. (2000). The handbook of psychophysiology (Second ed., p. 12). New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press. 23\nPage 25: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Information (data) sources We commonly collect from three sources of information. \u2022 Physiological \u2022 Subjective: \u2022 Questionnaires, interviews, debriefings \u2026 \u2022 Behavioural \u2022 Responses, response times, error rate \u2026 Aside from IV, DV, and MeV, these can be used as CtV. For example, a higher error rate (behaviour) may lead to frustration, biasing other parameters. 24\nPage 26: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Within- versus between-subjects Because of individual differences, there is a large between- subjects variability of most psychophysiological measures. Within-subjects variability tends to be lower. Therefore, psychophysiology usually uses within-subjects designs. 25\nPage 27: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Within-subjects Within-subjects blockwise design Experiment with two workload conditions: \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d.

For example, in \u201cnoisy\u201d and \u201cquiet\u201d conditions, adaptation first to noise or stillness may influence the way the other condition is perceived. A between-subjects design, or between-subjects control condition may be necessary. 28\nPage 30: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Within-subjects Serial dependency: Example Example: serial dependency caused different brain areas to dominate depending on a task being done first or second. Krol, L. R. (2020). Neuroadaptive technology: Concepts, tools, and validations (Doctoral thesis, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany). 29\nPage 31: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Different analysis techniques 30 Generally speaking, two types of analysis techniques can be distinguished. \u2022 Continuous techniques consider a period of time as a whole, extracting parameters as DV that describe this period. IV is usually (a property of) an experimental condition. e.g.: Power in a frequency band throughout a condition. \u2022 Event-related techniques consider parameters following specific instances of time as DV. IV is usually (a property of) an experimental event. e.g.: Mean signal increase 200 ms after stimulus onset.\nPage 32: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Continuous or event-related? Continuous Measuring engagement in a video game depending on difficulty level Measuring drowsiness during driving Measuring the ability to focus on one voice in mixed speech Event-related Measuring reactions to visually presented pictures Measuring the physiological processing of errors Measuring movement intentions 31 In many cases, (semi-)continuous measurements can also be performed using events, e.g. using a secondary task.\nPage 33: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Event-related analysis 32 Participant saw something they liked Participant noticed they made a mistake Participant stubbed their toe Event-related analysis thus focuses on changes in physiological activity relative to specific events, rather than activity generalized across conditions. Note that the measurement itself is still continuous. The event-related analysis considers small windows of time relative to the event of interest.\nPage 34: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Epoching and ERP averaging 33 In EEG, the resulting time windows reflect event-related potentials, as they reflect measured potential differences. A single such time window is usually too noisy to see any meaningful effects.\nPage 35: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Epoching and ERP averaging 34 Epoching is the practice of extracting all time segments relative to specific events from a recording. When you take the average ERP across multiple epochs, activity that does not systematically vary relative to the event and a specific baseline is averaged out.\nPage 36: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Event markers 35 Given the high frequency of some physiological signals and the sub-millisecond precision of the recording equipment, accurate timing of relevant experimental events is important. Additional equipment may be necessary to obtain so-called event markers or triggers that accurately reflect the timing of experimental stimuli or manual responses.\nPage 37: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Event markers Photo: \u00a9 Brain Products GmbH 36\nPage 38: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Variable stimulus onset asynchrony 37 Variability of the signal requires multiple repetitions. These repetitions are usually spaced somewhat irregularly in time. 1 second s s s s s s s s 1 second s s s s s s s s\nPage 39: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Events Variable stimulus onset asynchrony Variable stimulus onset asynchrony avoids expectancy effects. Example: expectancy- related activity can be seen in EEG when participants anticipate upcoming events. Precisely-timed events may also systematically coincide with a particular phase of biosignal oscillations, creating a confound. 38 s s\nPage 40: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics Artefacts Specific focus of psychophysiological experimentation is on controlling EVs known as artefacts. \u201cArtefacts\u201d in the recording are those signals that do not represent the biosignal of interest. Artefacts can be of - external (mechanical, environmental), or - internal (biological) origin. 39\nPage 41: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: External External artefacts Electromagnetic activity in the environment is picked up by the electrodes. Most commonly, this is utility-frequency (50 Hz) \u201cline noise\u201d coming from e.g. power cables, computers, light bulbs\u2026 Any electrical device operating at any frequency can potentially contaminate the recorded signal. 40\nPage 42: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: External External artefacts: Example Graph by Benedikt Ehinger is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / Adjusted axis labels Train figure by klsgfx is in the public domain, via openclipart.org 41 50 Hz Line noise 16\u2154 Hz ? !\nPage 43: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: External Mechanical artefacts Mechanical artefacts are caused by movement of the equipment. The movement of an electrode across the skin can lead to differences in resistance, and thus differences in the recorded signal. The movement of electrode cables suspended in the air can lead to changes in their position in electromagnetic fields, thus causing differences in the recorded signal. 42\nPage 44: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: External Controlling external artefacts Ahead of time: \u2022 Shield the room and the equipment. \u2022 Use electrodes with pre-amplifiers. \u2022 Have participants be stationary and comfortable. Post hoc: \u2022 Preprocess data to remove known artefacts. \u2022 Discard contaminated data. 43\nPage 45: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts Internal artefacts A number of biological processes can either directly interfere with, or otherwise influence, the biosignal of interest. For example, when using electrodes on the skin, skin potentials are slow impedance differences caused by sweating, leading to slow changes in the recorded signal. 44\nPage 46: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: Internal Muscle activity Aside from causing mechanical artefacts, muscle activity by itself produces measurable electrical activity due to (near-)simultaneous muscle fiber action potentials. Being high-amplitude and near the surface of the skin, these signals interfere with other signals recorded at the skin.

(2013). Atlas of EEG Patterns (second ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 46\nPage 48: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts: Internal Second-order internal artefacts Rather than producing activity that interferes with the biosignal of interest, a number of natural biological processes influence the biosignal of interest itself. For example, the respiratory cycle can be seen in ECG: breathing in increases the heart rate, and breathing out decreases it. In psychophysiology, essentially any psychological state that is not the \u03a8 of interest can influence \u03a6 and affect the recording. 47\nPage 49: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts Systematic versus random artefacts When artefacts are sufficiently random across conditions, their effects may ideally average out. Internal artefacts in particular can be systematically related to the experimental manipulation. This can lead to erroneous conclusions about the experimental effect. - More sweating in one condition - Frowning when something goes wrong - Eye blinks after stimulus onset - Personal thoughts specific to one condition 48\nPage 50: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Specifics: Artefacts Controlling internal artefacts Neutral, temperature- controlled environment Low electrode impedance Comfortable, stationary participants Guided gaze fixation Signal post-processing Exclude contaminated data Clever experimental design!

Physiological parameters can be event- related or continuous. Special care must be taken that external and internal artefacts are controlled for. Note that artefacts can be systematically related to the manipulation. 51\nPage 53: Psychophysiology: Experimentation Additional issues to consider 52\nPage 54: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Issues Ethics of human experimentation 53 Psychophysiological experimentation relies on human participants. The experimenter is responsible for the well- being of their participants. Research comes second. Declaration of Helsinki (1964; current revision 2013) agreed, among other things, on participant\u2019s right to - make informed decisions (e.g. informed consent) - self-determination (e.g. quit experiment at any time) - not be subjected to unnecessary risks, etc.\nPage 55: Psychophysiology: Experimentation: Issues Incidental findings 54 Even non-medical experimental recordings may reveal indications of medical significance, e.g. related to epilepsy (EEG), cysts (fMRI), or cardiac arrhythmia (ECG). Send recorded data for medical review? Inform participants of these findings? Psychophysiological research does not generally use standardized tests for reliable clinical diagnosis. Likely to find many false positives. Participants may or may not want to know.\nPage 56: * Psychophysiology Part 4: Psychophysiological experimentation Dr. Laurens R. Krol krol@b-tu.de 55"

Activation of a motor unit follows an all-or-nothing principle. Activation of a muscle can vary depending on the amount and size of active motor units. The ratio ranges from 1:3 to 1:3000, allowing fine or gross motor activity. 15\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Electromyography: Physiology Motor unit / muscle fiber action potentials A motor unit action potential (MUAP) is carried by the neuron, triggering a muscle fiber action potential (MFAP) in the postsynaptic muscle fibers. Muscle fiber action potentials have \u2022 a slightly lower resting potential (-85 mV), \u2022 a slightly longer duration (up to 5 ms), and \u2022 a slower velocity (3 \u2013 5 m/s). 16\nPage 18: Psychophysiology: Electromyography: Physiology Origin of EMG 17 A R + + \u2013 ++++ + mV\nPage 19: Psychophysiology: Electromyography: Physiology Motor unit potentials A motor unit potential (MUP) refers to the sum of all muscle fiber action potentials of a single motor unit. This is what EMG measures. The measured signal is thus a function of \u2022 the number of detected active motor units, and \u2022 the rate at which they are firing. Multiple motor units each firing at around a maximum of 50 Hz, but not all firing at the same time, can add up to much higher frequencies. This is why muscle activity is often broadband signal. 18\nPage 20: Psychophysiology: Electromyography Measuring EMG 19\nPage 21: Psychophysiology: Electromyography: Measurement The EMG signal: Raw Figure by StruskaM is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 20\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Electromyography: Measurement The EMG signal: Spectrum Cacioppo, J.

This - brings necessary oxygen and nutrients to the organs; - transports waste products; - regulates the bodily temperature; and - aids endocrine communication.

This heart musculature is different from smooth and skeletal muscles. A small percentage of cardiac muscle cells, known as pacemaker cells, has the ability to spontaneously produce action potentials. They automatically depolarise over time without external stimulation, and cause the muscle to contract. This is known as autorhythmicity. Cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocites) are connected to each other through gap junctions, allowing cardiac action potentials to be freely conducted between cells. 12\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Pacemaker (conductive) cells Figure by OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / cropped 13\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Contractive cells Figure by OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / cropped 14\nPage 16: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Neural conduction The sinoatrial node is a group of pacemaker cells located at the superior wall of the right atrium. Its signal contracts the atria, and then reaches the atrioventricular node near the inferior part of the interatrial septum. This node slightly delays the signal, allowing the atria to fully contract, before conducting the signal through the Bundle of Hiss and the Purkinje fibers into the ventricular walls, which then contract. 15\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Neural conduction Figure by OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 16\nPage 18: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Heart rate The SA node is the primary pacemaker, with the AV node yoked to its sinus rhythm. The SA node has an intrinsic rhythmicity of about 100 bpm; the AV node of about 40-60 bpm, the Bundle of His 20-40. The fastest available rhythm dominates the others. A denervated heart would beat on its own at around 100 bpm. The autonomous nervous system can modulate the cardiac autorhytmicity, both to slow it down (parasympathetic) and to speed it up (sympathetic) as needed. 17\nPage 19: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Autonomic influence Figure by OpenStax is licensed under CC BY 4.0 / cropped, removed text 18 Neurotransmitters open additional Na+ and Ca2+ channels (sympathetic), or open additional K+ channels (parasympathetic), influencing the rate of depolarization.\nPage 20: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Neural conduction and the ECG Figure \u201cECG principle slow\u201d by Kalumet is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 19\nPage 21: Psychophysiology The cardiovascular system The cardiovascular system contains a pulmonary and a systemic circulation, driven by two each of the four chambers of the heart: the right and left, respectively, atria and ventricles. The myocardium contains pacemaker cells with an instable resting potential, producing autorhythmicity. Neural conduction, also enabled by the gap junctions between the cardiomyocites, spreads throughout the heart and causes sequential contractions. 20\nPage 22: * Psychophysiology Part 6.1: The cardiovascular system Dr. Laurens R.

In the cardiovascular circulations, blood presses against the vessel walls. In medicine, the unit millimetres of Mercury (mmHg) is generally used instead of the SI unit Pascal (N/m\u00b2).

The baroreflex and other feedback loops regulate these parameters. In the baroreflex, when arterial baroreceptors sense an increase in blood pressure, this leads to a decrease in cardiac output, and vice versa. 5\nPage 7: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: Pressure Cardiovascular innervation Figure source unknown 6 The vasomotor centre in the medulla oblongata regulates blood pressure. The heart has both para- and sympathetic efferents; most blood vessels only have sympathetic innervation (effecting mostly vasoconstriction). Higher structures (cerebral cortex, limbic system) can influence the vasomotor centre, which explains cardiovascular responses to e.g. emotional stress.\nPage 8: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: Pressure: Measurement Sphygmomanometry Photo by ML5 is in the public domain Diagram \u201cKorotkow English\u201d by PhilippN is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 7\nPage 9: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: Pressure: Measurement Sphygmomanometry: Disadvantages 8 Not fully accurate: may be off by some 5-10 mmHg Temporarily deforms the arteries: a 10-minute recovery period should be allowed before additional measurements on the same arm Not continuously measurable Not unobtrusively measurable\nPage 10: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: Pressure: Measurement Continuous measurement Continuous measurement of true blood pressure is only possible invasively. An arterial line must be inserted into the artery. Other techniques have been developed, but rely on correlations of blood pressure with other measures. These correlations are complex. No standard has yet emerged. Figure \u00a9 Maryanne Mariyaselvam / KLIPS 9\nPage 11: Psychophysiology Blood pressure Blood pressure varies between systolic maxima and diastolic minima, which can be measured in the arteries. Sphygmomanometry is commonly used to obtain single measures of blood pressure. Continuous measurement for psychophysiology is not practically viable. 2021-10-20 10\nPage 12: Psychophysiology Peripheral blood volume 2021-10-20 11\nPage 13: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular Peripheral blood volume Vasomotor activity of peripheral blood vessels allows more or less blood to enter specific regions. This is sometimes readily observed, e.g. in blushing. Accurate measures can also detect minimal changes, some of which have psychological relevance. Figure: Wappers, G. (1827). Anthonie van Dijck verliefd op zijn model. Rijksmuseum SK-A-1159 12\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular Peripheral blood volume Peripheral blood volume is usually measured at the finger, where many blood vessels are close to the skin surface. Furthermore, measurements at the finger are not complicated by the presence of skeletal muscles. Vasomotor activity in the skin is exclusively under sympathetic control. Peripheral blood volume measures thus indirectly describe sympathetic ANS activity. Peripheral blood volume also varies with heart rate: systole increases, and diastole decreases the blood volume in the arteries. As a result, it is often primarily used as a heart rate monitor. 13\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: Volume Photoplethysmography (PPG) A plethysmograph measures and records changes in the volume of a (part of a) body. A photoplethysmograph uses infrared light to measure changes in blood volume indirectly. It detects changes in light absorption and refraction, which depend on blood perfusion.

This activity represents the summed action potentials of the myocardium throughout the cardiac cycle. The high amplitude of the ECG biosignal makes it detectable even with generic hardware. The activity is in the range of 1-100 Hz. There are a number of different ways to place the electrodes. 20\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG Electrode (lead) placement 21\nPage 23: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Placement Einthoven\u2019s triangle 22\nPage 24: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Placement Einthoven I, II, and III Figure by 10ebyu10e is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 23\nPage 25: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Placement Modern developments Diagram and upper photo by OpenStax are licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 Lower photo \u00a9 VivaLNK, Inc. 24\nPage 26: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG Peaks and intervals Figure by Agateller (Anthony Atkielski)/atom is in the public domain 25 P: Atrial depolarization QRS: Ventricular depolarization T: Ventricular repolarisation\nPage 27: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular system: Heart Neural conduction and the ECG Figure \u201cECG principle slow\u201d by Kalumet is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 26\nPage 28: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG Electrocardiogram Figure \u201cNsr\u201d by ECGpedia is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 / Removed fifth cycle 27\nPage 29: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG Ventricular fibrillation Figure \u201cVentricular fibrillation\u201d by Jer5150 is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 Figure \u201cAutomated External Defibrillator Amsterdam airport\u201d by Stevenfruitsmaak is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 28\nPage 30: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Parameters Heart rate Heart rate (HR) is the number of contractions (beats) of a heart per minute (bpm). Easily operationalised from an ECG as the number of R peaks per minute. HR responds to almost all physical and psychological changes: e.g., pain and fear increase, whereas relaxation and attention decrease HR; but even circadian and menstrual cycles can influence HR. This bidirectionality is an advantage for psychophysiology. Slow changes can be recorded by taking e.g. HR measurements per minute. 29\nPage 31: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Parameters Heart rate variability Changes in HR can also be operationalised as another metric in itself: heart rate variability (HRV). The inter-beat interval (IBI) is the distance between two successive R peaks. Many metrics can be constructed from this, e.g. arithmetic means, standard deviations, RMSSD = \u03c3\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc41\u22121 (\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56+1\u2212\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc56)2 \ud835\udc41\u22121 , proportion of successive intervals above a threshold, \u2026 RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) is often preferred for statistical reasons. HRV also allows spectral analyses. 30\nPage 32: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Parameters: HRV Spectral analysis: Cardiac time 31 1100 ms 900 ms 1050 ms 800 ms Time (ms) 1500 500 1 2 3 4 5 \u2026 Cardiac time (beats)\nPage 33: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Parameters: HRV Spectral analysis: Actual time 32 1100 ms 900 ms 1050 ms 800 ms Time (ms) 1500 500 0 1100 2000 3050 3850 Actual time (ms)\nPage 34: Psychophysiology: Cardiovascular: ECG: Parameters: HRV Spectral analysis: Processed signal Lombardi, F.

The various peaks and intervals have clinical significance. In psychophysiology, more focus is placed on heart rate and heart rate variability. HRV can be spectrally analysed to obtain information about ANS balance. 36\nPage 38: * Psychophysiology Part 6.2: Cardiovascular measures Dr. Laurens R. Krol krol@b-tu.de 37"

The subcutaneous tissue or hypodermis below is not technically considered to be part of the skin, but connects the skin to the body. Reticular layer\nPage 11: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity: Skin: Histology Layers of the dermis 10 The papillary layer connects to the epidermal basal layer and is named for the dermal papillae. Dermal papillae are small extensions that project into the epidermis, improving the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products, as the epidermis has no blood vessels. They also strengthen the bond between dermis and epidermis. They appear as ridges on the epidermis of thick skin, known as fingerprints on the fingertips.

They are only found in specific regions (e.g. armpits, areola, anus, pubic), and begin working during puberty. \u2022 Eccrine sweat glands secrete 99% clear H2O, and are present almost everywhere. An estimated 2 \u2013 5 million glands are found at different densities, with ~2000/cm2 at the palms and soles, down to ~100/cm2 elsewhere. 19\nPage 21: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity: Skin: Histology Sweat glands \u201cHautFingerspitzeOCT\u201d by the medOCT group, Medical University Vienna, Austria is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0 AT 20\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity Skin conductance Eccrine sweat glands are known to be the main factor in skin conductance, because: \u2022 Skin conductance is strongest in areas with the highest density of eccrine sweat glands, even though the skin itself is thicker there. \u2022 EDA responses are strongest in those same areas. \u2022 No such responses are measured in people without eccrine sweat glands. \u2022 The response can be eliminated by e.g. chemically blocking the signals responsible for gland activation.

The eccrine glands in the hands and feet respond weakly to temperature, and more strongly to psychological stimuli.

It aids or enables protection, sensation, and regulation. Eccrine sweat glands in the dermis are exclusively under sympathetic control, and respond to psychological stimuli. 24\nPage 26: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity Measuring EDA 25\nPage 27: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity: Measurement Conductance We will focus on conductance, as potential recordings are less common, and the mechanism still not fully explained. Conductivity C is the reciprocal of resistivity. Ohm\u2019s law: Therefore: The conductivity unit siemens (S) is thus \u03a9-1, with electrical conductance additionally dependent on the surface of the electrode, finally using S/m as unit. For EDA, the scale is usually in \u00b5S.

The unipolar reference site should be made neutral, e.g. using a subdermal electrode. Bipolar recordings sites should be innervated from the same spinal nerve. 27 Bipolar recording Unipolar recording A R\nPage 29: Psychophysiology: Electrodermal activity: Measurement Recording conductance The non-dominant hand is often used as the corneum tends to be thinner.

A possibly more reliable measure of general arousal is the rate of non-specific fluctuations, e.g. per minute.

Therefore, synchronous activity of larger cell populations is needed for a large enough electrical effect to be measurable at the scalp. In fact, both temporal synchrony and an appropriate spatial organisation is required for this.\nPage 17: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical activity: Physiology Electrical interference Synchronous, equally oriented currents add up.

Postsynaptic potentials last longer (10-250 ms), allowing their synchronous activity to summate to be measurable at the scalp. Aside from temporal synchrony, this requires a physical arrangement of the neurons that does not cancel out the synchronous electric fields.

For a highest frequency of interest at 100 Hz, we may thus sample at 1000 Hz with a low-pass filter at 500 Hz. 12\nPage 14: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Recording Artefacts Aside from the general artefacts already discussed, e.g. - environmental artefacts, - mechanical artefacts, - skin potentials, and - muscle activity (face, neck, jaw), eye movements are a prominent source of artefacts in EEG recordings. 13\nPage 15: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Recording Eye movements Original eye figure by ZStardust is in the public domain 14 + ++ ++\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2192 t mV \u2191 + \u2013 \u2192 t mV \u2191 + \u2013 \u2192 t mV \u2191\nPage 16: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Recording Eye movements During horizontal eye movements, the corneo- retinal dipole induces potential changes across the scalp.

Essentially, our brains are always active: a living person\u2019s EEG is never silent. Different frequencies can be dissociated in this spontaneous EEG activity. 18\nPage 20: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures Spontaneous EEG activity Figure by lrkrol is in the public domain 19\nPage 21: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Delta rhythm (1-4 Hz) - Associated with phases of deep sleep, which are therefore also known as \u201cslow-wave sleep\u201d phases - Associated with (induces) the release of a number of hormones - No known cognitive or affective correlates 20\nPage 22: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Theta rhythm (4-8 Hz) - Associated with transition phases from asleep to awake - Associated with increased cognitive strain - Associated with the processing of new information - (Also associated with activity in the hippocampus, but this has little bearing on scalp EEG) 21\nPage 23: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) - Dominant regular frequency in human EEG (aside from bursts of delta activity) - Most prominent during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes, primarily over occipital sites - Alpha desynchronization (reduced alpha activity) is associated with attention and cognitive work, especially in combination with simultaneous theta synchronization (increased activity) 22\nPage 24: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Mu (sensorimotor) rhythm (8-13 Hz) - Similar to alpha, but distinguished from the alpha rhythm by location: the mu rhythm is associated with the motor cortex - Mostly observed when no motor actions are performed 23\nPage 25: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Beta rhythm (12-30 Hz) - Associated with mental and physical activity - Often split into lower/higher ranges, e.g. at 20 Hz 24\nPage 26: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Gamma rhythm (30+ Hz) - Associated with attention and sensory processing - Associated with integration and association of information across distributed networks - \u201cPrototypical\u201d gamma is 40 Hz 25\nPage 27: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity Neural oscillations The oscillatory nature of these various rhythms may reflect feedback loops in the brain, e.g. time-delayed connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Peak frequencies vary across persons. Frequency band definitions are largely historical and vary from field to field, time to time, expert to expert. It is a gross simplification to simply equate activity of any frequency with any particular function. At the very least, take into account where in the brain the activity occurs, and in what context. 26\nPage 28: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spontaneous activity EEG contains activity of all frequencies All frequency bands are always represented in EEG. More generally, in fact, any signal can be decomposed into mixtures of different frequencies. (With EEG, some bands just have names.) 27\nPage 29: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures Frequency domain analysis 28\nPage 30: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spectral Power spectrum One way to analyse EEG is to look at its power spectrum, representing the power in all the different frequencies contributing to the recorded signal. 29\nPage 31: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Spectral Example experiment: Mu-band desynchronisation In different conditions, participants are asked to a) rest, or b) grasp an object and repeat this multiple times with pauses in between.

We can look at multiple frequency bands at the same time, as well the spatial patterns of different frequency bands, to obtain more specific results. As such, we can for example differentiate between different types of imagined movement, and phases of high and low mental load. 40\nPage 42: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures Time domain analysis 41\nPage 43: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures Event-related analysis 42 Participant saw something they liked Participant noticed they made a mistake Participant stubbed their toe Rather than brain activity generalized across conditions, can we detect changes in brain activity in response to specific events?\nPage 44: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Temporal The event-related potential (ERP) 43 A segment of EEG activity investigated relative to a specific event is called an event-related potential. Participant saw something they liked Participant noticed they made a mistake Participant stubbed their toe\nPage 45: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Temporal Epoching and ERP averaging 44 Looking at one such ERP, you will probably find nothing. This is because there is too much other (brain) activity going on that is not related to the event.\nPage 46: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Temporal Epoching and ERP averaging 45 Epoching is the practice of extracting all time segments relative to specific events from an EEG recording. When you take the average ERP across multiple epochs, activity that does not systematically vary relative to the event and a specific baseline is averaged out.\nPage 47: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Temporal ERP components Figure \u201cComponentsofERP\u201d by Mononomic is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 46\nPage 48: Psychophysiology: Electrocortical measures: Temporal Example experiment: Word semantics Data from: Kappenman, E.
